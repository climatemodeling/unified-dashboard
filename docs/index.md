# Land Model Testbed (LMT) Unified Dashboard

## What is the LMT Unified Dashboard (UD)?

The Land Model Testbed (LMT) unified dashboard, powered by Tabulator and the jQuery JS library, illustrates the high-level results from analysis and benchmarking software in the form of data tables (similar to a 2-D heat map). It treats the result as a function of multiple independent (hyperdimensional) inputs and displays the result as a combination of the two inputs.
