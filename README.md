LMT Unified DashBoard
=====================

Powered by the [Tabulator](https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator) and jQuery JS library, 
the Land Model Testbed (LMT) Unified Dashboard illustrates the high-level results from analysis 
and benchmark software in a data table.  It treats the results as a function of multiple  
independent inputs and shows the results in any combinations of two inputs.   

### The major functions of LMT Unified Dashboard include:

- CMEC JSON schema ready: it can parse JSON files in the CMEC JSON schema and show the result.
- Column hide/show: columns in the table can be hided by right-clicking  over the column header 
and choosing "Hide Column" or clicking the column title in the "Hide Columns" drop-down menu on 
the left side of the page. Columns can be shown again after hide by clicking the column titles in 
the "Hide Columns" drop-down menu or clicking the cross sign in the menu makes all hide columns show at once. 
- Column movement: columns in the table can be moved horizontally by dragging and moving the column. 
It provides the function that two columns can be compared with each other side-by-side.
- Table transpose: the table can be transposed by reversely selecting the inputs in the X/column and Y/row menus
 in the left side of the page.
- Column sort: clicking the column header toggles the sort of the table rows based on the values of the column
 in a decreasing and increasing order. It is useful when we want to rank models, metrics and others.
- Collapse and expand rows:  the child rows can be collapsed to and expanded from their parent rows. 
So users can focus on the results in a higher level first and look at the details later. 
- Row flatten: remove the tree structures and flatten them.
- Tooltip: the cell value/attribute is shown in a little box next to it when users hover a table cell with a mouse.
- Colorblind colors: provide colorblind colors.
- Column groups: distinguish columns  from the background colors on their header. 
- Icon: Icon can be added in the top-right corner of the table.
